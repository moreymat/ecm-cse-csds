# Assignment 2

- Find a tabular dataset that you will then work on for the final project.
- Write a short description on the dataset, that you will send me by email :
    * why the dataset is interesting and relevant,
    * what the dataset contains,
    * what types of analyses (dataviz, prediction) you intend to perform on it.
- Once I validate your dataset, prepare a presentation (5 minutes max.), based on the description you sent me, that you will present to the class on the next session (Monday 25th October).

Rules :
- You **cannot** choose a dataset we have already worked with : the European Past Floods dataset, Open Food Facts, iris etc.

Lead in case you do not know where to look :
