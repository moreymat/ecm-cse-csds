# Assignment 2

## Description

- Find a tabular dataset that you will then work on for the final project.
- Write a short description for the dataset :
  - why the dataset is interesting and relevant to you (as a person or as an environment engineer),
  - what the dataset contains (cf. the section "Read the documentation" in the notebook on "European past floods"),
  - what types of analyses (dataviz, prediction) you intend to perform on it.
- Send me your description by email at <mathieu@datactivist.coop> **no later than Wednesday 20th October**, so that I can validate your choice of dataset and assess the quality of your argumentation.
- Once I validate your dataset, prepare a short (5 minutes max.) presentation (PDF slideshow) for the description you sent me, that you will present to the class on the next session (Monday 25th October).

## Rules

- Each student needs to find a different dataset (hence my validation).
- Datasets are attributed on a first come, first served basis.
- You **cannot** choose a dataset we have already worked with : the European Past Floods dataset, Open Food Facts, iris etc.

## Leads

In case you do not know where to look :

- the EU open data portal has environmental datasets with files in the CSV format, but you need to browse through the documentation and look at the dataset before you can decide whether it is amenable to analysis (ie. it contains enough observations and variables) : <https://data.europa.eu/euodp/en/data/dataset?res_format=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.europa.eu%2Fresource%2Fauthority%2Ffile-type%2FCSV&vocab_theme=http%3A%2F%2Fpublications.europa.eu%2Fresource%2Fauthority%2Fdata-theme%2FENVI>

## Evaluation

You will be graded on:

- the quality (clarity, relevance) of the arguments you send me,
- the quality (clarity, relevance) of the short presentation you will deliver to your colleagues.

## Calendar

- Wednesday 20th October : deadline to send the description of your dataset,
- Monday 25th Octobre : presentation to your colleagues.
